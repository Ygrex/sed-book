\section{Ed Quick Start}
Complete guides and tutorials can be easily found online as well as
in OS distribuition repositories. GNU manual is quite exhaustive for
example: \href{https://www.gnu.org/software/ed/manual/ed_manual.html}
{The GNU ed line editor}.
Below is a quick start guide with tips helpful on daily basis (if it
happens that Ed is used daily).

First of all, since Ed predates rich UI solutions being wide spread
or event capable terminals development, it might be convenient to
wrap it with
\href{https://github.com/hanslub42/rlwrap}{rlwrap}
or other
\href{https://tiswww.cwru.edu/php/chet/readline/rltop.html}{Readline}
enhancer. There is no assumption made in this guide though.

Normally Ed session starts in a directory where files will be modified or
created. It won't change working directory in run-time.
Let it be \lstinline{sed-book/} directory:
\begin{lstlisting}
$ mkdir sed-book
$ cd sed-book
$ ed
\end{lstlisting}
There is no prompt by default, so it runs and simply waits for user input
with no visual feedback. It is initialized with an empty buffer, the
active mode is a command mode.

Ed's buffer is a mixed concept of Sed's input stream and pattern space.
Similar to Sed's input stream it can be addressed by a line number or
a context, there is a current line number counter, no regular expressions
span across line boundaries (use input in bold):
\begin{lstlisting}[escapeinside={(*}{*)}]
(*\bfseries \# buffer is initially empty:*)
(*\bfseries \$=*)
0
(*\bfseries \# add sample text to see how addressing work:*)
(*\bfseries a                          *)
(*\bfseries Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet,*)
(*\bfseries consectetur adipiscing elit,*)
(*\bfseries sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore*)
(*\bfseries et dolore magna aliqua.*)
(*\bfseries .*)
(*\bfseries \# address a line by its number:*)
(*\bfseries 2p*)
consectetur adipiscing elit,
(*\bfseries \# address by a context:*)
(*\bfseries /\char`\^sed/p*)
sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore
(*\bfseries \# there is a notion of the current line number:*)
(*\bfseries .=*)
3
\end{lstlisting}

Note that \lstinline{a} command entered the input mode which ended by a line
with a single dot \lstinline{'.'} character.
When one needs to literally put such a line in the input mode,
there is no way of doing that in one command. Some different text is
entered first and transformed by \lstinline{s} command later.

Going forward user input and Ed output will not be
distinguished by a typeface because there is no real
visual distinction when working with Ed.

So far four lines were appended to the Ed's buffer. Unlike Sed, output
stream, the one, which is operated on by \lstinline{a},
\lstinline{c}, \lstinline{i}, \lstinline{r} and other commands,
this output stream is connected to the same buffer.

Like Sed's pattern space, transformation commands readily
operate with the data in the buffer. Transformations never
span across line boundaries but can be repeated on a few
lines in one command:
\begin{lstlisting}
,s/^/	/
,p
	Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet,
	consectetur adipiscing elit,
	sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore
	et dolore magna aliqua.
\end{lstlisting}

Note the substitution string is a literal TAB, metacharacter
\lstinline{'\t'} won't work. With Readline wrapper the way
of entering literal TAB is pressing \lstinline{Ctrl-V} followed
by \lstinline{TAB} button.

Address \lstinline{,} refers to every line in the buffer, so that
the substitution repeated for every line.

As usual, the longer one uses Ed, the more commands they get custom to.
Here is the full typescript of a session of working with Ed with most
techniques important for the development as used later in the book.

\end{lstlisting}

If everything went right \lstinline{book.pdf} appeared and can be examined
with a PDF viewer.
In many ways it could go wrong, so as a rule it is better to save all the time,
check filenames before nearly every \lstinline{w} command, make backups with
a version control system such as Git.

After gaining certain experience and mastering all Ed commands,
the editing might become even more efficient than with screen oriented
alternatives, but unlikely convenient to the same degree
with all the excessive efforts and concentration
required.

Absence of syntax highlight, inability of changing individual characters and
other editor limitations are charming not less than programming in Sed.
