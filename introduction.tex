\section{Introduction}
This book is about a streaming editing programming with modern development techniques.

What exactly modern techniques are, will be discussed in details later.
Just brief examples here will give a hint for the beginning:
structuring code in functions, classes, modules, projects,
covering program with unit-tests, versioning and distribution.
All techniques are trivial in context of
nowadays mainline programming languages,
but counter-intuitive otherwise.
This book presents few possible approaches to those trivialities
with certainly ``otherwise'' language \Emdash GNU Sed.
